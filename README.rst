How to run the code with inputs given in the terminal
--------
This package genereates a 2d NOESY spectrum of plumed chemical shifts. In this example cs-cs-100.dat in final_project folder has the plumed outputs. The package computes NOEs and makes a plot of it and save it as final_project.png. Another file that is needed is called COLVARN_outputs has the labels of atoms from which the NOEs are computed.
